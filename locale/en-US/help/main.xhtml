        <h1>Welcome to Scriptify</h1>

        <p>
            Scriptify allows you to create and manage restartless add-ons made
            from Scriptish and Greasemonkey userscripts. Creating a new add-on
            is as simple as right clicking a user script link, or choosing a
            local file via the Add-on Manager:
        </p>

        <div class="screenshots" style="height: 271px;">
            <div class="hfil"/>
            <img class="screenshot" src="&skin;context-scriptify.png"/>
            <div class="hfil"/>
            <div style="line-height: 271px">
                <img class="screenshot" src="&skin;am-scriptify.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="hfil"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            Once you've finished
            <a href="edit.xhtml">entering the add-on details</a>, your new
            add-on will be automatically installed and can be managed via its
            Add-on Manager entry:
        </p>

        <div class="screenshots">
            <img class="screenshot" src="&skin;am-addon-scriptify.png"/>
        </div>

        <p>
            The following actions are available:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Edit</dt>
            <dd>
                Edit the add-on's metadata (name, description, version, â€¦),
                add or remove scripts, and adjust how scripts are executed.
                On completion, the add-on is refreshed.
            </dd>
            <dt>Browse</dt>
            <dd>
                Browse the add-on's root directory. From here, you can edit
                your add-on's scripts, add resources such as images and HTML
                files, and even directly edit Scriptify metadata. This option
                is only available when the add-on is unpacked.
            </dd>
            <dt>Export</dt>
            <dd>
                Export the add-on to an XPI file suitable for distribution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Update</dt>
            <dd>
                Updates the Scriptify loader included in the add-on, along
                with the requisite application compatibility information.
            </dd>
            <dt>Refresh</dt>
            <dd>
                Reload the add-on, applying any changes made to its internal
                scripts. This is useful when editing scripts via the Browse
                function above.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pack/Unpack</dt>
            <dd>
                Packs or unpacks the add-on. Add-ons are ordinarily run
                directly from their XPIs for performance reasons. However, in
                order to ease development, the XPIs can be unpacked into a
                directory which can then be browsed and modified.
